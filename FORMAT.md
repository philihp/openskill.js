# SPEC.md FORMAT

Single file. Project root. Every cavekit command reads it.

## SECTIONS

Fixed order. Fixed headers. Addressable.

```md
# SPEC

## §G GOAL

one line. what code must do.

## §C CONSTRAINTS

- bullet. non-negotiable boundary.
- bullet. tech/lang/lib locked in.

## §I INTERFACES

external surface. what world sees.

- cmd: `foo bar` → stdout JSON
- api: POST /x → 200 {id}
- file: `config.yaml` schema ...
- env: `FOO_KEY` required

## §V INVARIANTS

numbered. testable. each ! MUST hold.

V1: ∀ req → auth check before handler
V2: token expiry ≤ ⊥ allowed
V3: DB write ! in transaction

## §T TASKS

pipe table. ids monotonic (never reused). status: `x` done / `~` wip / `.` todo.

id|status|task|cites
T1|.|scaffold repo|-
T2|.|impl §I.api POST /x|V2
T3|x|add §V.1 middleware|V1,I.api

## §B BUGS

pipe table. backprop log. each row = bug + invariant that catches recurrence.

id|date|cause|fix
B1|2026-04-20|token `<` not `<=`|V2
B2|2026-04-21|race on write|V3
```

**Table cell rules**: literal `|` -> escape as `\|`. Backticks OK. Cells trimmed. Empty = `-`.

## ADDRESSING

`§~~. ` = section.item. `§V.2` = invariants section, item 2. Commands, commits, PRs all reference by §. Zero ambiguity.

## CAVEMAN ENCODING

Default for every section.

Rules:
- Drop articles (a, an, the). Drop filler.
- Drop aux verbs (is, are, was) where fragment works.
- Short synonyms (fix > implement).
- Fragments fine.
- **Preserve verbatim**: code, paths, identifiers, URLs, numbers, error strings, SQL, regex.

**Symbols** (save tokens, machine-readable):

```txt
→ leads to / becomes / triggers
∴ therefore / fix
∀ for all / every
∃ exists / some
! must
? may / optional
⊥ never / impossible / forbidden
≠ not equal / differs from
∈ in / member of
∉ not in
≤ at most
≥ at least
& and
| or
```

**Bad** (v1 prose):
> The authentication middleware must verify the token expiry on every request before allowing the handler to execute.

**Good** (v2 caveman):
> V1: ∀ req → auth check before handler

**Bad** (prose bug note):
> Fixed a bug where token expiry comparison used strict less-than instead of less-than-or-equal, causing tokens to be rejected exactly at their expiry timestamp.

**Good** (v2 caveman):
> B1: token `<` not `<=` ∴ tokens rejected @ expiry. §V.2 now ! `<=`.

## WHY CAVEMAN FOR SPECS

Spec loaded every invocation. 75% fewer tokens = 75% fewer dollars & faster reads. Human skims fast too. Symbols unambiguous.

## ONE FILE RULE

Big project → more sections, not more files. grep ceremony kills agent speed. If SPEC.md > 500 lines, compact §B (old bugs drop oldest) before splitting.

## WRITES

| command | writes | section |
|---|---|---|
| `/spec new` | creates | all |
| `/spec amend` | edits | chosen |
| `/spec bug` | appends | §B + §V |
| `/build` | flips | §T status cell `.` → `~` → `x` |
| `/check` | - | read only |

That is whole format.
